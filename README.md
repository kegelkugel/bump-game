# bump-game
A fun arcade game where you have to bump against other players and must avoid dangerous walls, written in Python.
It's inspired by some (Xbox ?) game I've played recently but don't know the name of.

The development is in a very early stage, but unfortunately I currently don't have the time to work further on it.
Especially the collision algorithm has to be improved, and lots of other stuff has to be added, like menus, limited number of boosters, power-ups, dangerous enemies, multiplayer support etc.
If someone enjoys working on this further, please do so, I'd be more than happy to see where this can go!

I'd also love to play this game on my phone one day â€¦
